## ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm SomÄ“.
I'm a classically trained pianist and creative developer
now retraining to chase my dream of becoming a software developer.

Although I have a Masters in New Music Performance, I've always had a connection to
technology. According to my parents, I learnt how to type before I could
properly write with a pencil. My earliest memory of using a computer was having
access to a PowerPC mac when I was 7 running Rhapsody with some kind of explorative
encyclopedia software on it.

In 2018, I taught myself to code using Processing. At that time, I had a 2008
Black Macbook that couldn't even run the latest browser. I installed Linux on it
and began hacking away!

Since then, I've come a long way. My projects so far have been focused on
multimedia, merging live performance with interactive software, like
Lokal/Digital, and frontend applications, like Polymetro, that run in the
browser. 

In these years of hacking, I've used many technologies, programming languages
like C++, Javascript, Kotlin, Clojure, patching environments like PureData and
Max/MSP, and much more. The feeling that the things that I build have some
application in the real world is what excites me about software development! 

Right now, I'm looking both to expand my understanding and abilities as a
developer and for opportunities to work as part of a team with the passion of building.

## Autobiographical details 

I'm a Malaysian born and raised in Brunei, living in Germany
since 2014. I live with my loving partner in SaarbrÃ¼cken.
