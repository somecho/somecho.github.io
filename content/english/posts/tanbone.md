[Tan Bone](https://tanbone.art) is an art installation by LiLi (KSA) and [Joshua
Weitzel](https://joshuaweitzel.jimdofree.com) for which I developed a companion
web application.

The user interface of the web app was built in Vue. It features a
realtime-rendered graphical element inspired by traditional Myanmar textiles
which was created in [p5.js](https://p5js.org). The main feature of the app is
its interactive component, which was built with
[howler.js](https://howlerjs.com). With the app open in a mobile device's
browser, shaking the device will activate recordings of protests and
demonstrations that took place after the 2021 coup in Myanmar.
