## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm SomÄ“!

I'm a classically trained pianist taking the leap software development. 

Although I have a Masters in New Music performance, I've always had a strong
connection to computers that started before I could even write. According to
my parents, I learnt how to type before I could hold a pencil. 

I found a way to bridge my passion for computers with my music profession in
2019. Together with the dancer and choreographer Evelin Stadler, I developed
an experimental performance combining dance, free improvisation and a machine
learnin enabled audiovisual system, which I trained on recordings of my own
playing. Since then, I've worked with performers like Desmond Cheese, the Grow
Quartet and pianist Natyra Elezi, finding ways to augment their practices with
technology.
