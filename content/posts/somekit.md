summary: "A collection of multipurpose utility functions for creative coding in Clojure(Script)."

In January of 2023, I decided to participate in Genuary23 and, at the same
time, learn and use ClojureScript for it. In the process, I developed a utility
kit called [Somekit](https://github.com/somecho/somekit), a creative coding
toolkit library in ClojureScript, which I used for most of my ClojureScript
projects.

It features the following namespaces: 
- ca1d - implementation of discrete and continuous 1D-cellular automata
- color - color utility functions
- geometry - geometry utility functions
- geometry.line - utility functions relating to lines
- math - commonly used math and random functions
- vec - functions to work on vectors as collections and units
- window - utility functions for window dimensions

Here's my summary of Genuary23 where I used Somekit extensively.

## Future

As each namespace grow, I plan to separate them out into their own
libraries in the future.
